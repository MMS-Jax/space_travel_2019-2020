# Space Travel Calculator by <YOUR FIRST NAME and LAST INITIAL> on <DATE YOU WRITE THE CODE>. 

# First declare variables for MILLION, BILLION, and TRILLION.  These will be used to convert distances later in the program. 

million = 1000000
billion = ? # Replace the ? with the correct value for billion. 
trillion = ? # Replace the ? with the correct value for trillion. 

# Next we need to declare the variables that will store the AVERAGE distances to each object in the Solar system.  Use Kilometers (Km) for your unit of measure.
# Mars is 225 million Km from Earth on average.  So we create a variable dist_to_mars and set it equal to 225 multiplied by the million variable. 
dist_to_mars = 255 * million 
print("The distance to Mars is", dist_to_mars, " ilometers.") # Use this to check the math is correct. 

# Create two more variables for objects INSIDE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.  Make sure to convert the distances using million, billion, or trillion.  print() the variables 
# check that they are correct. 

dist_to_? =
dist_to_? =
